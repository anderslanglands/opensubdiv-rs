//! Far is the primary API layer for processing client-supplied mesh data into
//! subdivided surfaces.
//!
//! The Far interface may be used directly and also may be used to prepare mesh
//! data for further processing by Osd. The two main aspects of the subdivision process are Topology Refinement and
//! Primvar Refinement.
//!
//! ## Topology Refinement
//! Topology refinement is the process of splitting the mesh topology according
//! to the specified subdivison rules to generate new topological vertices,
//! edges, and faces. This process is purely topological and does not depend on
//! the speciific values of any primvar data (point positions, etc).
//! Topology refinement can be either uniform or adaptive, where extraordinary
//! features are automatically isolated (see feature adaptive subdivision).
//! The far topology structs present a public interface for the refinement
//! functionality provided in [vtr],
//!
//! The main classes in Far related to topology refinement are:
//!
//! * [TopologyRefiner](crate::far::topology_refiner::TopologyRefiner) - A class encapsulating mesh refinement.
//! * [TopologyLevel](crate::far::topology_level::TopologyLevel) - A class representing one level of refinement within a
//! [TopologyRefiner](crate::far::topology_refiner::TopologyRefiner).
//! * [TopologyRefinerFactory](crate::far::topology_refiner_factory::TopologyRefinerFactory) - A factory class template specialized in terms
//! of the application's mesh representation used to construct [TopologyRefiner](crate::far::topology_refiner::TopologyRefiner) instances.
//!
//! ## Primvar Refinement
//! Primvar refinement is the process of computing values for primvar data (points, colors, normals, texture coordinates, etc) by applying weights determined by the specified subdivision rules. There are many advantages gained by distinguishing between topology refinement and primvar interpolation including the ability to apply a single static topological refinement to multiple primvar instances or to different animated primvar time samples.
//! Far supports methods to refine primvar data at the locations of topological vertices and at arbitrary locations on the subdivision limit surface.
//! The main classes in Far related to primvar refinement are:
//! * [PrimvarRefiner] - A class implementing refinement of primvar data at the
//! locations of topological vertices.
//! * [PatchTable] - A representation of the refined surface topology that can
//! be used for efficient evaluation of primvar data at arbitrary locations.
//! * [StencilTable] - A representation of refinement weights suitable for
//! efficient parallel processing of primvar refinement.
//! * [LimitStencilTable] -	A representation of refinement weights suitable for
//! efficient parallel processing of primvar refinement at arbitrary limit
//! surface locations.
